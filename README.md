# Title

Thyme2Cook

## Description

Application that helps the user decide what to cook whenever they need some inspirations. On the landing page, the user is given a few different recipes selected at random that they can try. The user can also search for recipes by inputting an ingredient, type of cuisine, dietary restriction, cooking equipment, and more. After searching, the user is presented with some recipes matching the input that they searched. The user can click on any of these recipes or the ones on the landing page to be presented with a recipe card containing ingredients and instructions to create the dish. This application was created to continue practicing my React skills and also to learn Material UI. This application is going to be developed further and more functionality will be added in the future. The next implementation will be creating an alternative way to view ingredients and instructions for recipes as certain recipes do not have a card if they have too many ingredients.
